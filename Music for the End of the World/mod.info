description=This mod adds many new lore-friendly songs through the "True Music" framework. If you want songs around the turn of the century, enable Music for the End of the World Extended. If you want a small, choice selection of modern songs, enable Music for the End of the World Home Labelled. If you want a chunk of Silent Hill tracks, enable Music for the End of the World Silent Hill. This pack is not required for the other packs in this mod to work, even though it is the 'main' one.
